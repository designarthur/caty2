                <p class="terms-paragraph">By creating an account, accessing our website, utilizing our AI booking system, requesting quotes, or engaging in any transaction through Catdump, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. This agreement is effective immediately upon your first use of the Services and continues for as long as you use the Services. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "Client," or "Customer") and Catdump ("Catdump," "we," "us," or "our"). We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time without prior notice. Your continued use of the Services following any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. We recommend reviewing these Terms periodically to stay informed of any updates.</p>

                <h2 class="terms-subheading" id="description-of-services">2. Description of Services</h2>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">Catdump operates as an online marketplace connecting users with local, vetted equipment rental and related service providers ("Suppliers"). Our Services include, but are not limited to, the facilitation of:</p>
                <ul class="terms-list">
                    <li><strong>Dumpster Rentals:</strong> Various sizes and types for waste disposal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temporary Toilets:</strong> Portable sanitation solutions for events and construction sites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage Containers:</strong> Secure, on-site storage units.</li>
                    <li><strong>Junk Removal Services:</strong> Facilitated through AI-powered visual quotation systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relocation & Swap Services:</strong> For existing rental units.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI Booking System:</strong> An intelligent chat interface for initial inquiries and quote requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Dashboard:</strong> A personalized portal for managing orders, tracking deliveries, viewing invoices, and communicating with Suppliers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Secure and flexible payment options, including financing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">Catdump acts solely as an intermediary and marketplace provider. While we strive to connect you with reliable Suppliers and ensure competitive pricing, we do not directly own, operate, or provide the rental equipment or services ourselves. The actual rental agreements and service execution are between you and the respective Supplier. Catdump's responsibility is limited to facilitating the connection and providing the platform tools.</p>

                <h2 class="terms-subheading" id="user-accounts">3. User Accounts</h2>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="account-registration" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">3.1 Account Registration</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">To access certain features of our Services, such as requesting quotes, placing orders, and managing rentals, you must register for a Catdump account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete. Failure to do so may result in the suspension or termination of your account.</p>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="account-security" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">3.2 Account Security</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify Catdump immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. Catdump cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="eligibility" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">3.3 Eligibility</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">You must be at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding contract to use our Services. By registering an account, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements. Catdump reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, or cancel orders at its sole discretion.</p>

                <h2 class="terms-subheading" id="ordering-and-quotation-process">4. Ordering and Quotation Process</h2>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="requesting-a-quote" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">4.1 Requesting a Quote</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">Our AI booking system facilitates the initial request for quotes. You will provide details about your equipment needs, project, location, and timeline. This information is crucial for our system to accurately process your request and for our network of Suppliers to provide relevant quotes. For services like junk removal, you may be required to upload visual media (images, videos) for AI analysis and quotation generation. You warrant that all information provided is accurate and that any uploaded media accurately represents the items for removal.</p>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="quote-generation-and-presentation" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">4.2 Quote Generation and Presentation</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">Upon receiving your request, Catdump's system will engage with our network of vetted local Suppliers to obtain competitive pricing. These quotes will be presented to you on your personalized customer dashboard. Each quote will include details such as pricing, rental duration, delivery fees, pickup fees, and any specific terms or conditions from the individual Supplier. Catdump strives to present the best available options based on your criteria, but we do not guarantee the lowest price from all possible providers outside our network.</p>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="quote-acceptance-and-order-confirmation" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">4.3 Quote Acceptance and Order Confirmation</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">You can review and accept a quote directly from your dashboard. By accepting a quote, you are entering into a direct contractual agreement with the respective Supplier for the provision of the equipment or service. Catdump's role shifts from a facilitator of quotes to a manager of the transaction on your behalf. An invoice will be generated and made available on your dashboard for payment. Order confirmation will be sent to you via email and reflected in your dashboard.</p>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="pricing-and-fees" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">4.4 Pricing and Fees</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">All prices quoted are subject to change until an order is confirmed and paid for. Prices typically include the rental fee for the specified period, delivery, and initial pickup. Additional fees may apply for extended rental periods, overweight charges, prohibited items, damage to equipment, difficult access, or cancellation fees. These potential additional fees will be outlined in the Supplier's terms, which you agree to review and accept upon order confirmation. Catdump will clearly communicate all known fees before payment.</p>

                <h2 class="terms-subheading" id="payments-and-billing">5. Payments and Billing</h2>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="payment-methods" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">5.1 Payment Methods</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">Catdump accepts various secure payment methods, including major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover) and ACH transfers. All transactions are processed through secure, encrypted payment gateways. We do not store your full credit card details on our servers.</p>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="payment-due-dates" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">5.2 Payment Due Dates</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">Payment for rental services is generally due in full at the time of order confirmation, unless a specific financing plan or payment schedule has been agreed upon. For services with variable costs (e.g., junk removal based on weight), an initial deposit may be required, with the final payment due upon completion of the service and accurate assessment of final charges.</p>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="financing-options" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">5.3 Financing Options</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">For eligible clients and larger projects, Catdump may offer flexible financing plans. The terms and conditions of such financing will be governed by a separate agreement, which must be reviewed and accepted by you prior to availing the financing. Eligibility for financing is determined solely by Catdump and/or its third-party financing partners.</p>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="refunds-and-disputes" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">5.4 Refunds and Disputes</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">Refunds are issued in accordance with our Cancellation Policy (see Section 6). If you have a billing dispute, you must notify Catdump within 30 days of the invoice date. We will investigate the dispute in collaboration with the relevant Supplier to reach a fair resolution. Excessive or unfounded disputes may result in account suspension or termination.</p>

                <h2 class="terms-subheading" id="cancellations-changes-and-returns">6. Cancellations, Changes, and Returns</h2>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="cancellation-policy" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">6.1 Cancellation Policy</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">Cancellation requests must be made through your Catdump dashboard or by contacting our support team. The following cancellation fees may apply:</p>
                <ul class="terms-list terms-list-nested">
                    <li>Cancellations made 24 hours or more before the scheduled delivery time: Full refund, minus a small processing fee (if applicable).</li>
                    <li>Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the scheduled delivery time: A cancellation fee equivalent to a percentage of the total rental cost or a flat fee may be charged to cover dispatch and administrative costs incurred by the Supplier.</li>
                    <li>Same-day cancellations or refusal of delivery upon arrival: May result in no refund and the full charge of the rental.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">Specific Supplier cancellation policies may vary and will be communicated at the time of booking. It is your responsibility to review these policies.</p>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="changes-to-orders" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">6.2 Changes to Orders (Relocation & Swap)</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">Requests for relocation or swapping of rental units must be submitted through your dashboard or by contacting support. Such requests are subject to Supplier availability and may incur additional fees, including but not limited to, transportation fees, new rental period charges, or restocking fees for swapped units. Catdump will provide a revised quote for any changes, which must be accepted by you before the change is implemented.</p>
                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="returns-and-pickups" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">6.3 Returns and Pickups</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">Equipment pickup will be scheduled based on your initial rental period. It is your responsibility to ensure the equipment is accessible and ready for pickup at the agreed-upon time. Failure to do so may result in additional charges, including trip fees or extended rental fees. Please ensure the equipment is emptied (for dumpsters) and in the same condition as received, reasonable wear and tear excepted.</p>

                <h2 class="terms-subheading" id="user-responsibilities-and-conduct">7. User Responsibilities and Conduct</h2>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">As a user of Catdump Services, you agree to:</p>

                    <li>Ensure safe and clear access for delivery and pickup of equipment. Obstructions or unsafe conditions may result in delayed service and additional charges.</li>

                <h3 class="terms-subheading" id="limitation-of-liability" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">9.2 Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Catdump, its affiliates, directors, employees, agents, or licensors be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including without limitation, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to your use of, or inability to use, the Services.</p>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">In no event shall Catdump's total liability to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action exceed the amount paid by you to Catdump for the specific Services giving rise to the liability in the twelve (12) months preceding the date of the claim.</p>
                <p class="terms-paragraph">This limitation of liability applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if Catdump has been advised of the possibility of such damage. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>

                <p class="terms-paragraph">You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Catdump, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to:</p>
